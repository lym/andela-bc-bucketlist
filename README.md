# Bucketlist
This project is an implementation of a bucketlist app. This project is
being developed primarily as a requirement of the Andela pre-bootcamp
activity.

## Usage
For now the project is previewable with a web browser via `file://`

You can point a browser to `file://[project path]/home.html` from there
you are able to navigate to the login and sign up pages.

Note that <i>new</i> and <i>edit</i> forms are structurally identical
except the former contains prefilled data.
